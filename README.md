# WindowsSearchAlternative
Quick and dirty file search thing in Python because Windows 10 Search is about as useful as a raccoon in your trash can, and Microsoft refuses to fix it, though that's not saying this isn't equally as useless.<br /><br />
Can currently search by file name, extension, and .txt and .docx contents after pointing it at a root directory/drive.<br /><br />
Currently extremely inefficient and not very smart.<br /><br />
